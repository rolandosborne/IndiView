IndiView is a social media alternative app designed to work with the self-hosted network [diatum](https://diatum.org). With IndiView, you can maintian your contact list, share pictures and videos, and chat all while having full privacy and control of your data. Your data is transmitted only between self-hosted nodes and your device. IndiView maintains a server only to provide a searchable list of public profiles for when you want to add a new contact.

Within the app you seletively share your contact info, photos and videos so your contacts will not all see your identity in the same way. Family may have access to photos or phone numbers that a coworker may not.
